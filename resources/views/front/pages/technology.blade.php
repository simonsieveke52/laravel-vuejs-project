                    How Natural House Works
                </p>
                <p class="px-2 mb-5 lead">
                    Natural house probiotic cultures are naturally occurring beneficial organisms that have been selected from balanced natural ecosystems in nature. These probiotics have maintained life’s subtle balance on earth and they are now helping maintain that same balance in your own home.

                <p class="px-2 mb-5 lead">
                    The surfaces in your house are like a garden. If you don’t seed with good plants, weeds will grow. You have the same choice with your household surfaces : sanitize for a moment with harsh chemicals leaving your surface open to recontamination or seed with probiotics to continuously weed out the bad micro-organisms.

                <p class="px-2 mb-5 lead">
                    Traditional cleaners “clean” a surface for a moment in time; the second the rag is finished wiping the surface, that surface is almost instantly polluted once again with ambient dust, dirt, and micro-organisms. Natural House probiotics creates a mini-ecosystem on a microbial level that produces enzymes which break down odors, dirt, fats, oil, grease, food scraps, waste and toilet paper products on a continuous basis between applications. This creates a natural, clean, balanced environment that is safe for even the most sensitive members of your natural house.
                </p>
                <p class="px-2 mb-5 lead">
                    Natural House uses carefully selected non-pathogenic and non-toxic probiotic bacteria combined with natural, plant-based, biodegradable synergistic ingredients to plow through the toughest cleaning problems in your natural house.
