					<p>
						If you’re looking to return or exchange your order for whatever reason, we're here to help! Please note the following important technical details (there are only two!):
					</p>
					<p>
						for items which we stock, and for special order, or non-stocked items.
					</p>
					<p>
						For items which we stock (noted on the product page as “In Stock”: We offer <strong>free returns or exchanges</strong> within <strong>30 days</strong> of receiving your order. You can return your product for <strong>store credit, a different product,</strong> or a <strong>refund</strong> to the original payment method.
					</p>
					<p>
						For special order, or non-stocked items (noted on the product pages as requiring a lead time, for example: “Ships in 7-14 days”), this means that we had to order that item especially for you.  This complicates our ability to accept a return.  In most cases, we will be able to accept your return, but may have to ask that you accept an exchange or store credit, rather than an outright refund.  This will help us to defray the costs of shipping your unwanted item back to the supplier, and obtaining our own credit for the item which you decided not to keep. In all cases we will be happy to work this out with you. Simply email us your desires to <a href="mailto:orders@advancedworld.com">orders@advancedworld.com</a> and we will respond same day or latest next day.  Please be sure to include your contact information so we may reach out to you to resolve your issue.
					</p>

					<p class="font-weight-bold">Please note the following exceptions to our return and exchange policy:</p>

					<p class="mb-0">
						<ul>
							<li>Returned items must have no visible signs of wear or use</li>
							<li>
								Liquidation items are final and cannot be returned or exchanged To initiate a return or exchange, please complete the following steps:

								<ul>
									<li>Login to our online return portal using your email address and order ID</li>
									<li>Choose the products you wish to return or exchange from your order</li>
									<li>
										Indicate the form of credit you wish to receive including: a store credit to be applied to your next purchase, an exchange item (you ordered the wrong flow rate, or size, etc.) or an outright refund in the form you paid. Typically this will be a refund to your credit card, PayPal, etc.
									</li>
									<li>Print your prepaid shipping label that you will receive by email</li>
									<li>Send all items back to us using the label provided</li>
								</ul>
							</li>

						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Additional Information:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Once we receive your return, please allow us a few days (usually less than three) to process your return request. 
							</li>
							<li>
								When we made the error, we will be happy to pay all shipping costs.  But if you made an error, we will help too! Using our shipping label to complete a return will not charge you any cost for shipping.  That’s right, we will pay your return shipping costs. If you choose to use another service however, you will have to pay those shipping costs.  You decide!
							</li>
							<li>
								Generally, we will not charge a restocking fee. If your item was In Stock, and the items have been returned unused and in the original packaging, we will issue a full refund, exchange or credit for the item(s) returned. 
							</li>
							<li>
								If an item is lost or damaged when shipped via our label, we will only issue a store credit or exchange.  A refund cannot be issued for any item which is not successfully returned to us for evaluation and possible recycling.
							</li>
							<li>
								If an item is lost or damaged using your choice of shipping company, you will have to file a claim with that carrier.
							</li>
							<li>
								If you have any questions about our returns policy, or if we can assist you further in any way, please phone us to speak with a concerned human at 310-534-4000.  Kindly note that we are in California, so PST, and work normal business hours, Monday to Friday, and sometimes 24/7/365 ;)
